# Port-Scanner
Developed a Python-based port scanner using the “nmap” library 

Scanned target hosts to identify open ports and running services 

Utilized options “-sV” and “-sC” for version detection and default scripts 

Parsed and displayed hostnames, states, and protocol information 

Provided detailed output of port states for network analysis and security assessment
